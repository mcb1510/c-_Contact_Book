# Personal Contact Manager

## Description
The Personal Contact Manager is a simple console application written in C++ that allows users to manage their contacts. It supports adding, displaying, searching, and deleting contact information. Based on this tutorial website: https://hackr.io/blog/cpp-projects

I decided to write this program so I could review my knowledge of C++ OOP (function, classes, data structures)

## Features
- **Add Contact:** Allows the user to add a new contact with details such as first name, last name, email, and phone number.
- **Display Contacts:** Lists all the contacts currently stored.
- **Search Contact:** Enables searching for a contact by their first name.
- **Delete Contact:** Allows the user to delete a contact by entering the contact's first name.

## How to Compile and Run
To compile and run this project, you need a C++ compiler (like GCC or Clang). Follow these steps:

1. Save the source code in a file named `main.cpp`.
2. Open your terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where you saved `main.cpp`.
4. Compile the program. For example, using g++ you would type:
5. Run the compiled program:

## Requirements
- C++ Compiler (GCC, Clang, etc.)
- Basic knowledge of terminal/command prompt usage
